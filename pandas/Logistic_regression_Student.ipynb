The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf), the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks.

        "\n",
        "**Label Encoding** assigns a value from 1 through N for each category for the feature, here we are assuming there are N categories. For eg:  Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) has already been encoded numerically.\n",
        "\n",
        "Label Encoder assumes that there is some order in the data, i.e., value 2 is greater than value 1, which is good if the data is ordinal but it is not suitable for nominal data types without any inherent order, such as mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g., administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other'), in such cases we need to perform some other encoding method, such as one-hot Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "**One-hot Encoding** maps each category to a vector that contains 1 and 0 denoting the presence or absence of the feature. Hence, this method will create multiple columns based on the features' cardinality, i.e., the number of categories in the feature. For: e.g.: Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g., administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') has four different categories. Hence four columns will be created.\n",
