    "This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf), the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks.

    "\n",
    "**Important note:** the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful."

For eg:  Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 - 5th to 9th grade, 3 - secondary education or 4 - higher education) has already been encoded numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoder assumes that there is some order in the data, i.e value 2 is greater than value 1, which is good if the data is oridnal but it is not suitable for nominal data types without any inherent order, such as mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other'), in such cases we need to perform some other encoding method, such as one-hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**One-hot Encoding** maps each category to a vector that contains 1 and 0 denoting the presence or absence of the feature. Hence, this method will create multiple columns based on the cardinality of the features, i.e number of categories in the feature. For: eg: Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') has 4 different categories, hence 4 columns will be created.\n",
