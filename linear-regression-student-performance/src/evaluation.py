### Summary of the Assignment

In this assignment, we trained a linear regression model to predict students' final grades (G3) based on various features from a dataset containing student performance data. The process involved several steps, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison with a baseline model.

### Steps Taken

1. **Import Libraries**: We imported necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Load Data**: The dataset was loaded from a specified URL into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. **Train-Test Split**: The data was split into features (X) and target (y), and then further divided into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio to prevent data leakage.

4. **Data Visualization**: We plotted histograms to visualize the distribution of various features and scatter plots to analyze relationships between features and the target variable.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: We calculated the correlation of numerical features with the target variable (G3) to identify the most influential features for our model.

6. **Model Training**: 
   - We first trained a linear regression model using the top five features that showed the strongest correlation with G3.
   - We then preprocessed the data to include all features, applying label encoding for categorical variables and one-hot encoding for nominal variables.

7. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

8. **Baseline Model**: We created a baseline model using `DummyRegressor` that predicts the mean of the training data. We compared the performance of our linear regression model against this baseline to assess its effectiveness.

### Key Results

- **Top Features Correlation**:
  - G2: 0.908877
  - G1: 0.788115
  - Failures: -0.318010
  - Medu: 0.238431
  - Age: -0.184941

- **Model Performance**:
  - RMSE (Top 5 Features): Approximately 2.34
  - MAE (Top 5 Features): Approximately 1.61
  - RMSE (All Features): Approximately 2.42
  - MAE (All Features): Approximately 1.61
  - RMSE (Baseline Model): Approximately 5.26
  - MAE (Baseline Model): Approximately 4.12

### Conclusion

The linear regression model performed significantly better than the baseline model, indicating that the features used in the model are indeed predictive of the students' final grades. The model's RMSE and MAE values suggest a reasonable level of accuracy, although there may still be room for improvement through further feature engineering or model tuning. 

### Next Steps

To enhance the model's performance, consider the following:
- Experiment with different regression algorithms (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, or Polynomial Regression).
- Perform feature selection to identify and retain only the most impactful features.
- Explore interactions between features or polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
- Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
